University project to create a bot which integrated with the Twitter API. This twitter bot then ran a game of poker for people who tweeted at it.

I worked within a team of four, performing tasks such as developing code, QA testing, peer reviews, and project management. We had scrum meetings often, even if only over Skype, to keep up on progress and to help manage our time.
